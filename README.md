# Texas-Targeted Books

The [Texas Tribune reported](https://www.texastribune.org/2021/10/26/texas-school-books-race-sexuality/)
on Oct. 26, 2021 that Texas State Rep. Matt Krause,
in his role as chair of the Texas House Committee on General Investigating,
opened an official investigation into the presence of hundreds of books
in Texas schools, and has required all Texas schools to report on the
                books' presence.

Here is a best-effort presentation of the Rep. Krause list
